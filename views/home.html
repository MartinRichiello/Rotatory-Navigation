        <h1>Bakery</h1>
        <small>Cakes, cookies and other desserts</small>

        <p>Baking cakes, cookies, and other sweets is more than just a kitchen task—it's a delicious blend
          of science and creativity. The process starts with simple ingredients like flour, sugar, eggs,
          and butter, which transform into soft, golden treats through the magic of heat and chemistry. 
          Whether you're creaming butter and sugar for cookies or whipping egg whites to fold into a fluffy
          cake batter, each step plays a key role in the final result. Precision matters, from measuring
          ingredients to setting the right oven temperature, but there's always room for a personal touch
          through flavors, fillings, and decorative flair.

          Beyond the technical side, baking is also a form of expression and a way to bring people together.
          The smell of freshly baked cookies often brings back childhood memories, while a beautifully decorated
          cake can turn an ordinary gathering into a celebration. Even experimenting with new recipes—like
          gluten-free brownies or matcha cupcakes—adds excitement to the experience. Whether you're baking
          to relax, to share, or to satisfy a sweet craving, the joy that comes from creating homemade
          treats is as satisfying as the sweets themselves.</p>

        <p>Baking is more than just mixing ingredients—it's a joyful art that brings comfort, creativity, and connection.
           Whether you're making cakes, cookies, or other sweet treats, each dessert tells its own story. So preheat that
            oven, follow your passion, and share the delicious results with those you love.</p>
